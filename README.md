**Main feature:**
- You can use python on your requests and import any script or library.
- Your request files can be imported and executed in python.
- As it's used with pytest, it's ready for CI/CD and can be combined with Playwright or any other library.
- It's file based so it's git ready.
- It uses Jinja2 or Python syntax.
- Rapid development using low code user interface.
- Request chaining powered by Jupyter Notebooks.


## Usage

Install the python library under a virtual environment.

```pip install zapy-sdk```

Install the VSCode Extension.
Create a `.zapy` file, for example `my_first_request.zapy` and open it using VSCode.


## Requests

Integrated on VSCode using an extension.

## Stores
Stores enable the persistence and inspection of Python data for use in multiple requests, including the creation and management of [environment variables](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/environment_variables).

## Hooks
Hooks can be global or request-specific, allowing interception and modification of requests, such as for [authentication](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/authentication).

```python
from zapy.requests import hooks, HttpxArguments

@hooks.pre_request
async def on_each_request(httpx_args: HttpxArguments):
    httpx_args['auth'] = ('alice', 'ecila123')
    print(httpx_args)
```

## Chaining
[Chaining](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/chaining) runs a sequence of requests with one click, using responses from one request in the next. It also offers the ability to use conditionals or to resume from a failed step.

## Integration test
Requests and their tests can be invoked directly on your scripts or tests.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pytest

from zapy import requests
from zapy.utils import module


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_single():
    request = requests.from_path("request1.zapy")
    response = await request.send()
    response.json()

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_chain(self):
    rel_path = Path('tests/assets')
    chain = await module.load_ipynb(
        rel_path / 'chain_import.ipynb',
        variables={
            'rel_path': rel_path
        },
    )
```

_The pythonic REST client and testing tool._

# Zapy REST Client - SDK

Zapy REST Client is an extension for VSCode that serves as a tool for testing APIs. The accompanying Zapy SDK, a Python library, is an integral component that enables the utilization of Zapy request files, empowering the client and Python scripts to perform API operations. The primary goal is to streamline the process of API testing.

## Requirements

Python 3.11+

For using the VSCode extension:
- Python virtual environment
- Zapy SDK
- VSCode

## Usage

1) Install [Zapy VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zapydev.zapy-rest-client).

2) Install the python library under a virtual environment.

    ```sh
    pip install zapy-sdk
    ```

3) Create a `.zapy` file, for example `my_first_request.zapy`.
4) Start the Zapy server.
5) Send your request üöÄ.

## Requests

Create requests visually using the [Zapy VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zapydev.zapy-rest-client).

![first look](https://docs.zapy.dev/assets/docs/first_look.webp)

## Stores
Stores enable the persistence and inspection of Python data for use in multiple requests, including the creation and management of [environment variables](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/environment_variables).


![stores](https://docs.zapy.dev/assets/docs/stores.webp)

## Hooks
Hooks can be global or request-specific, allowing interception and modification of requests, such as for [authentication](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/authentication).

```python
from zapy.requests import hooks, HttpxArguments

@hooks.pre_request
async def on_each_request(httpx_args: HttpxArguments):
    httpx_args['auth'] = ('alice', 'ecila123')
    print(httpx_args)
```

## Chaining
[Chaining](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/chaining) runs a sequence of requests with one click, using responses from one request in the next. It also offers the ability to use conditionals or to resume from a failed step.

![chaining](https://docs.zapy.dev/assets/docs/jupyter_chain.webp)

## Integration test
Requests and their tests can be invoked directly on your [integration tests](https://docs.zapy.dev/guides/testing/).

```python
import pytest
from zapy import requests

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_single():
    request = requests.from_path("request1.zapy")
    # if raise_assert is enabled, it will perform all assertions defined in the request file
    _ = await request.send(raise_assert=True)
```
